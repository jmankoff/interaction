## Assumptions
]
.right-column[
We have made a number of .red.bold[WRONG] assumptions about:
- what smartphones are
- how they are used
]

---
.left-column[
## Assumption #1: We all have smart phones

![:img Picture of a bunch of phones (some outdated), 100%](img/context/phones.png)

.title[Dumb (Feature) Phones]
.body[
We live in a time of dumb phones

Know almost nothing about me

Explicit preferences

Contacts

Running applications

Hardly knows when I’m mobile/fixed, charging/not charging

Doesn’t know me or what I’m doing
]

.corner-ribbon.purple.tlbr[WHY NOT???]

.left-column[
## Goal: Re-cast Assumption #1
![:img Smartphone, 100%](img/context/phone.png) 
]
.right-column[
Want to build a smart phone that
- Collects and learns a model of human behavior with every interaction
- From the moment the phone is purchased and turned on
- Uses behavior information to improve interaction and the user experience
- Do this opportunistically
 - Your noise is my signal!
 - Big Data of 1
]
???
How close are we to this?

- Amazing amounts of computation at hand
- Memory and storage
- Radios and communication
- Sensors
- Software
---
.title[Big Data of One]
.body[
Build compelling and useful apps that provide value in everyday life and a compelling user experience

Think about what you can do with big data for 1 with origins in everyday activity
]

.left-column[
## Assumption #2: Usage is Notification Driven
![:img People at a dinner table paying attention to their phones instead of eachother, 100%](img/context/dinner.png)
]
.right-column[
What do we know about how people use their mobile devices?

- “Always on the phone!”
- “Notifications are ruining my life!”

]
---
.title[Characterizing Usage]
.body[
![:img Picture of different kinds of usage including glance; review; engage; and phone calls showing that almost all include glancing at the lock screen while others also include the home screen (almost all) and applicaion usage also includes app-specific stuff, 80%](img/context/usage.png)

.footnote[Based on 1 months data from 10 participants]

.title[Characterizing Usage]
.body[
![:img Histograph of percentage of total device use sessions by
session duration showing that most sessions are lock screen only and
less than 60 seconds long, 80%](img/context/usage2.png)
]
???
95% of sessions shorter than 5 minutes; most < 60 secs

Notifications lead to engagement… only 25% of the time!

Self-interruption therefore more common than we would think

Notifications prevent unnecessary engages

No good support for reviews

## Opportunity: Leverage real knowledge about phone use 
![:img People at a dinner table paying attention to their phones instead of eachother, 100%](img/context/dinner.png)
]
.right-column[
Engage people when appropriate

Avoid interrupting when not

Make short interactions more powerful

![:img Picture of a mobile phone with an unlock gesture that also labels emails for keeping or discarding, 100%](img/context/proactive.png)

Provide access to email management, etc right on lock screen

## Example: pro-active tasks

Provide access to email management, etc right on lock screen

Study of phone use (10 users, 4 weeks)

95% of sessions shorter than 5 minutes; most < 60 secs

No good support for quick task completion (just viewing things)
]

.left-column[
## All users 

![:img Picture of a graph showing 3 weeks of use going from 15%
engagement down to 6.4% engagement, 100%](img/context/proactive-results.png)
]

.right-column[
## Results

25 participants
- 10 nonusers (4% of lockscreen views with a task or less per week)
- 9 regular users (5-10% of lockscreen views with a task per week)
- 5 power users (40-60% of lockscreen views!)
]
???
regular users  mostly used the tasks when they had some down time, or
when bored or nothing better to do.

power users who applied actions to email in more than 1/3 of sessions
when tasks were present on their lock screen.

.left-column[
## Cleaners

![:img Picture of a graph showing 3 weeks of use going from 39%
engagement down to 22% and then back up to 50% engagement, 100%](img/context/cleaneruser.png)
]
.right-column[
## Results

25 participants
- 10 nonusers (4% of lockscreen views with a task or less per week)
- 9 regular users (5-10% of lockscreen views with a task per week)
- 5 power users (40-60% of lockscreen views!)
- 3 'cleaners' 
]
???
We also found a special kind of power users called cleaners. They rarely had any unread emails in their inbox and used ProactiveTasks to keep their inbox clear of any unwanted emails.

.left-column[
## Assumption #3: Proximity is standard]
.right-column[
We assume that users have their phones with them and turned on 24-7

Which is great for things like health apps and behavior modeling
- Mobile phone is personal and travels with the user
- Proxy for user context
- Proxy for user’s environment context
- Proxy for user’s attention/display device
- Provide always-available service

## Assumption #3: Proximity is standard]
.right-column[
## How much of the day is your phone on?

Average user: 78-81% [Dey, 2011]

One-fifth of the time, phone is off
Can’t sense anything
Can’t show anything to the user

Can't use the phone as a proxy for the user 

May need complementary sensors

## Assumptions

- Assumption #1: Phones are smart
- Assumption #2: Usage is notification driven 
- Assumption #3: Proximity is standard
- Assumption #4: Need is necessary
]

.right-column[
By removing assumptions, we can recast: 

- the notion of what a smart phone is
- how we can use them to improve people’s lives
- how to leverage make (personalized) meaning from (your) big data

What might we make is in this case?
