Your boss has read up on Fitts’ law, and wants to put all the controls
at the bottom of the screen so they have infinite width and are easier
to click on. However, your colleague argues that they should be in a
pie menu which should pop up wherever the user presses instead. 

- D and W in each case
- Which is better?
- Time savings for eyes free (HARD!)

You have registered your app to listen for OffRoute callbacks (when the driver’s vehicle deviates from the route, onOffRoute() will be called). Correctly label each method call, based on what object (Application or View) calls it, and where you would put the code to implement it. 

 |                         | Called by application or view? | Implemented in application or view? |
 |-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
 | onOffRoute()            |                                |                                     |
 | setOnOffRouteListiner() |                                |                                     |
