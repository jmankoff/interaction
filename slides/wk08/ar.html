##        What is AR?

A combination of 
- a real scene viewed by a user and 
- a virtual scene generated by a computer that augments the scene with
  additional information.

Differences to VR?
Augmented Reality
- System augments the real world scene
- User maintains a sense of presence in real world
- Needs a mechanism to combine virtual and real worlds
- Hard to register real and virtual

## Brief History

- 1901 Lyman Frank Baum  author of “The Master Key” imagines a kind of AR.
- 1968 Ivan Sutherland invents first head-mounted display “Sword-of-Damocles” at University of Utah.
- 1999 ARToolkit was created by Hirokazu Kato at HITLab
- 2010 Vuforia for AR Mobile Apps was released by Qualcomm.
- 2013 Google announces Google Glass.
- 2015 Microsoft announces the HoloLens.
- 2016 Niantic released Pokémon Go.

.title[Difficult!]
.body[

Requires objects to behave in physically plausible manners when manipulated
- Occlusion
- Collision detection
- Shadows

AR systems sensitive to visual errors - virtual object may not be stationary in the
	real scene or it may be in the wrong place.

Time delays lead to augmented image lagging behind motions in the real scene.

???
Failures in registration due to:
Noise
Position and pose of camera with respect to the real scene
Image distortions
Time delays
In calculating the camera position
