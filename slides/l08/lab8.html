# CSE 340 Lab 7 (Spring 2019)
## Heuristic Evaluations, Sensing

## Heuristic Evaluations

- Incredibly useful interaction technique

- Reverts the application to an older state

  - Mistakes can easily be undone
  
  - *"Ugh...that was definitely not right, but manually erasing all this work is going to take forever"*

---

## The Redo feature

- Inverse to the Undo feature

- "Undoes" an undo

  - Work previously undone is reapplied

  - *"Huh, maybe I made the right decision after all..."*

---

## Codebase: Activity Files

- `MainActivity` inherits from `ReversibleDrawingActivity`, which inherits from `DrawingActivity`

- `DrawingActivity` - abstract class for app that supports drawing without history

  - Wrapper around a `DrawingView`

  - `doAction()`

- `ReversibleDrawingActivity` - abstract class that extends DrawingActivity

  - adds support for undo/redo

  - includes buttons for undo/redo

  - `doAction()`, `undo()`, `redo()`

- `MainActivity` - inherits from `ReversibleDrawingActivity`

  - adds support for thickness, color actions

  - `onColorSelected()`, `onThicknessSelected()`

---

## Codebase: DrawingView, Code Structure, and Layouts

- `DrawingActivity` is a wrapper around a `DrawingView`

  - Sets behavior for how strokes are drawn 

      -- Strokes are just `StrokeView`'s in the `DrawingView`

  - `onTouchEvent()` implements a PPS that describes lifetime of a stroke being created

- Useful diagram on the spec makes the code structure clear

- Also look at the layout files - you'll probably need to use them 

---

## Codebase: Actions

- `Action` abstract class defines basic behavior any Action should have

- `ReversibleAction` abstract class defines interface for actions that can be undone

- `DrawingActivity`'s `doAction()` calls `Action`'s  `doAction()` to apply an action

- `ReversibleDrawingActivity`'s `undo()` and `redo()` call methods on ReversibleAction to undo/redo 

- The three actions:
  
  - `ChangeColorAction`

  - `ChangeThicknessAction`

  - `StrokeAction`

---

## Codebase: History

- The `ReversibleDrawingActivity` uses an AbstractHistory interface to manage the undo/redo history

  - You will implement the concrete StackHistory which implements AbstractHistory

  - Think: What data structures are used? Why does this make sense?

      -- What happens to the redo history if you take a new action after undoing a couple times?

      -- What happens to the undo history if you redo an action?

      -- What happens to the redo history if you undo an action?

---

## Additional Responsibilities

- Add a new thickness button with stroke width 0

- Add a new feature

  - Can be a new FAB (cannot add another thickness, but could add another color)

  - Challenges:

      -- Leverage your ColorPicker

      -- Allow the user to move a stroke

- Improve usability (optional)

- Make sure all added features are accessible

---

## Demo: Adding a new color FAB

- This is very similar to adding a new thickness

- `color_menu.xml` is the layout file with all the color FABs

  - Create a new FAB 

      -- can just copy and paste, changing relevant attributes

  - Update MainActivity.java

      -- It already adds the other thickness and color FABs

      -- `addCollapsableMenu()` adds all buttons in an array to a menu and sets their listeners for you

          -- All you have to do is update the appropriate listener function (in this case, `onColorSelected()`)
