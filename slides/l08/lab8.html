# CSE 340 Lab 7 (Spring 2019)
## Heuristic Evaluations, Sensing
---

## Heuristic Evaluations

- You should have received an email with the survey link and APKs

- We will complete a heuristic evaluation on one submission in section today

    -- You must complete the remaining evaluations within the next day

- What do you do?

    -- Two passes through the interface: one to inspect flow, another to inspect each screen against heuristics

    -- Fill out Usability Action Report
---

## Evaluation criteria

- **Visibility of system status**
    -- Are users informed about what is going on in their application?

- **Match between the system and the real world**
    -- Does the app use concepts, language, and conventions that would be familiar to the user?

- **User control and freedom?**
    -- Does it allow the user to do what he/she wants to?

- **Consistency/Standards?**
    -- Does the application use the same conventions in all its components? Is it consistent with other apps on the same platform?

- **Error prevention?**
    -- Is the application defensive? Does it have a design that protects users from making mistakes?

- **Recognition rather than recall?**
    -- Are the objects/actions/options of the app easily accessible to newcomers, or do they require memory?

- **Flexibility and Efficiency of Use**
    -- Can the user customize the application to their needs?

- **Aesthetic and minimalist design**
    -- Is the application cluttered? Does it contain only relevant components?

- **Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors?**
    -- When the user runs into a problem, will it be easy for them to fix it?

- **Help and Documentation**
    -- Is help easy to find any navigate? Is the information given even helpful?

## Sensing

- Goals
    - Add Snapshot support for the Headphone, Location, and User Activity sensors
    - Add Fence support to listen for changes to the Location and Activity sensors
    - Create an application that leverages a sensor in some new way
    
- Snapshots
    - Return the most recent information from the sensor
        -- May not be real time

- Fences
    - Triggered when the sensor data changes based on signal conditions set
    - Can combine multiple conditions to create a smarter fence

- Take 10 minutes to read through the specification and the code files

---

## Sensing code

- Important object types to look at:
    
    - `FenceActivity.java`
    
    - `FenceBroadcastReceiver.java` - BroadcastReceiver that passes data relevant to the Fence in a callback
    
    - `ContextSnapshotActivity.java`

- Every Activity you will implement in this assignment is either a `FenceActivity` or a `SnapshotActivity`
    
    - There are classes of both types already implemented as an example for you

- Questions?

## Demo

- We will implement `HeadphoneFenceActivity` and `HeadphoneSnapshotActivity` together

- `HeadphoneSnapshotActivity.java`
    - `getHeadphoneState()` from the `response`
    - Get the appropriate `text_headphone` TextView in the `snapshot_headphone.xml` layout
    - Depending on if the headphones are plugged in, set the text on the TextView using string constants in `strings.xml`

- `HeadphoneFenceActivity.java`
    - call setupFence() with AwarenessFence objects
        -- use `HeadphoneFence` static methods to get the appropriate AwarenessFence instances
    - pass in a FenceActivityListener to setupFence()
        -- No behavior needs to be defined if the headphones are actively being plugged/unplugged
        -- Otherwise, get the FenceState and display the `text_headphones_plugged_in`, `text_headphones_unplugged`, or `condition_unknown` on the `text_headphone_fence` TextView
