| Error                | Description                                                                                                                   |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Clickable Items      | Overlapping clickable items                                                                                                   |
| Editable Image Label | TextView has a content description. This might interfere with a screen reader’s ability to read the content of the text field |
| Image Contrast       | Low contrast in image or icon                                                                                                 |
| Item Descriptions    | Items with identical speakable text                                                                                           |
| Item Label           | Missing element label                                                                                                         |
| Item Type Label      | Item label ends with type, e.g., “Play Button.” TalkBack automatically announces item type, so information is redundant       |
| Link                 | URL in link may be invalid                                                                                                    |
| Text Contrast        | Low text contrast between foreground and background                                                                           |
| Touch Target         | Item is too small|
