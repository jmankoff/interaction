# Final Exam Review

CSE 340 Spring 2019

layout: false

.title[Plan for Final (Monday 8:30-10)]
.body[
Will cover material from whole course

Emphasis on second half

Same basic structure, more questions
- Long answer questions
- Short answer questions
- Coding questions
- 'Cheat Sheet' allowed (2 sided, hand written)

Nothing on sustainability; augmented reality

.title[Subjective exam question advice]
.body[
Study by synthesizing and summarizing material

An adequate answer can get you around 85%
Ex:
Human eyes have cones that can see red green and blue. Yellow is just
a mix of these. 

A complete, deeper answer can get you an A 
Ex:
Our eyes can only detect red, green and blue wavelengths of light
(with cones) and greyscale (with rods). They see color as a
combination of these wavelengths. Thus, displaying “true” yellow
pixels won’t make a difference since our eyes will see them as a
combination of red and green anyway. 


When writing: Aim to stay within 10% of suggested length, make a point
and then provide support for it. A verbose answer may get you back to
B (if redundant or wrong)

.title[Core concepts from first half]
.body[

Input
- Input models (events)
- Event dispatch
- Event handling (PPS) likely coding problem
- Callbacks to application likely coding problem

Output
- Interactor Hierarchy design & use
- Drawing models (`onDraw()`) likely coding problem
- Layout (`onLayout()` or `XML`) likely coding problem
- Damage and redraw process
]

.title[And Introduced Model View Controller]
.body[
Model
- Model of a single interactor: Typically a field
- Application model
 - Separate from view model
- Typically more persistent (e.g., saved with bundler)

View
- `onDraw()` in a single interactor
- Interactor hierarchy in an application

Controller
- PPS in a single interactor
- callbacks (e.g., custom listeners) in an application

## 2D Drawing -> 3D modeling

Same core concepts

Now in OpenSCAD

Key ideas:
- 3D
 - `cube (size)`
 - `cylinder (h, r|d, center)`
 - `polyhedron (points, triangles, convexity)`
 - `sphere (radius | d=diameter)`
 ]
 
.right-column50[
## Similar Transformations

- Transformations
 - `translate ([x, y, z])`
 - `rotate ([x, y, z])`
 - `scale ([x, y, z])`
 - `resize ([x, y, z], auto)`
- Boolean operations
 - `union()`
 - `difference()` (subtract second from first)
 - `intersection()`
]

Limitations of 3D printing?

- Often visual, but not always (e.g., speech)
- Allows and promotes certain actions

  function the __system DOESNT HAVE__), gulf of
  evaluation is when the user __doesn't realize the system HAS a
  functionality__.

.title[HE pros and cons?]

.left-column50[
## Pros

Discount usability engineering

Intimidation low

Don't need to identify tasks, activities

Can identify some fairly obvious fixes

Can expose problems user testing doesn’t expose

Provides a language for justifying usability recommendations
]
.right-column50[
## Cons

Un-validated

Unreliable

Should use usability experts

Problems unconnected with tasks

Heuristics may be hard to apply to new technology
