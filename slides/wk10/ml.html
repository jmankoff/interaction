.title[How do these systems work?]
.body[

Machine Learning is used to make these kinds of predictions 
- Machine learning is one area of Artificial Intelligence 
- This is the kind that’s been getting lots of press 

The goal of machine learning is to develop systems that can improve
performance with more experience 
- Can use "example data" as "experience"
- Uses these examples to discern patterns 
- And to make predictions
]
---
.title[Two main approaches]
.body[
 Supervised learning (we have lots of examples of what should be
 predicted)
 
Unsupervised learning (e.g. clustering into groups and inferring what
they are about)

Can combine these (semi-supervised)

Can learn over time or train up front

.title[ML is a major shift in thinking]
.body[
Old Approach: Create software by hand
- Use libraries (like JQuery) and frameworks
- Create content, do layout, code up functionality
- Deterministic (code does what you tell it to)

New Approach: Collect data and train algorithms
- Will still do the above, but will also have some functionality based
on ML

.title[How Machine Learning is Typically Used]

Step 1: Gather lots of data (easy on a phone!)
]

.body[

Step 2: Figure out useful features
- Convert data to information (not knowledge!)

(typically) Collect labels

Step 3: Select and train the ML algorithm
- Lots of toolkits for this
- Lots of algorithms to choose from
- Mostly treat as a "black box"

See how well algorithm does using several metrics
Error analysis: what went wrong and why
Iterate: get new data, make new features

.title[What makes this work well?]
.body[
Typically more data is better

Accurate labels important

Quality of features determines quality of results

.title[AI / Machine Learning Not As Sophisticated as in Media]
.body[

A lot of people outside of computer science often ascribe human
behaviors to AI systems 
- Especially desires and intentions 
- Works well for sci-fi, but not for today or near future 

These systems only do: 
- What we program them to do 
- What they are trained to do (based on the (possibly biased) data)

Significant Societal Challenges for Privacy

.title[Wide Range of Privacy Risks]
.body[

| Everyday Risks     | Medium Risk         | Extreme Risks     |
|--------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Friends, Family    | Employer/Government | Stalkers, Hackers |
| Over-protection    | Over-monitoring     | Well-being        |
| Social obligations | Discrimination      | Personal safety   |
| Embarrassment      | Reputation          | Blackmail         |
|                    | Civil Liberties     |                   |

- It's not just Big Brother 
- It-s not just corporations 
- Privacy is about our relationships with every other individual and
  organization out there

.title[Five Reasons Why Privacy is Hard]
.body[
###1 Strong Incentives to for Companies to Collect Data 

- Barriers to collecting data are also really low 
- More data means better predictive models 

Data has strong potential to affect bottom line 
- Increasing relevance of online ads worth millions 
- "Post-purchase monetization"

.title[Five Reasons Why Privacy is Hard]

###2 Low Knowledge, Awareness, Motivation by Devs 
- Even those with CS degrees have little knowledge 
- In surveys and interviews, vast majority of app developers knew
  little about what privacy issues there were and how to address them 
- Many developers don’t realize how much data their app is collecting
(Or that it was collecting data at all)
 - App developers often use third-party libraries 
 - In one study, over 40% of apps collect data only because of these
 libraries
 - Some apps use several libraries, which mean your data is being sent
   to lots of third parties

###3 Companies Get Little Pushback on Privacy 

Let’s say you want to purchase a web cam 
- Go into store, can compare price, color, features
- But can’t easily compare privacy (or security) 
- So, privacy does not influence customer purchases 
- So, companies not incentivized to improve 

Less than 0.1% of reviews on Google Play mention privacy concerns 

This is a market failure – This is why companies assign privacy a low
priority

###4 Unclear What the Right Thing To Do Is 

Even if a company wants to be privacy-sensitive, it’s not always clear
what the right thing to do is

###4 Unclear  What the Right Thing To Do Is 
 
Even if a company wants to be privacy-sensitive, it’s not always clear
what the right thing to do is
- What is the best way
of informing people? 
- What is the best way of storing data? 
- How to best assess what is / isn’t acceptable?

.title[Five Reasons Why Privacy is Hard]

###5 Burden on End-Users is Too High 

Individuals have to be constantly vigilant

Individuals also   have to make too many decisions 
- Is this device good with respect   to privacy? 
- Should I install this app? 
- What are all the settings  I need to know? 
- What are all the terms and conditions? 
– Trackers,  cookies, VPNs, anonymizers, etc
