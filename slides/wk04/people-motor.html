This is just a line

Fitts’ law tells us about difficulty for pointing and selection tasks

were they fatal or recoverable with the right information?)
- How strenuous (e.g. gaze has lower throughput but is less strenuous
than head pointing Mackenzie 2018)
...
- Recall -- How much does the person remember
afterwards or after periods of non-use?
- Emotional Response -- How does the person feel about
the tasks completed? (Confident? Stressed? Would the
