.title[Review: Android Awareness API]
.body[
Link to overview [Awareness API](https://developers.google.com/awareness/) 

Unfortunately much of the documentation online is not up to date (last
updated in 2017)

.title[Non-programming requirements]
.body[
Emulator requirements: Play store installed
- Makes it easier to get your app working

Permission requirements: Correct API installed

Follow the “[Quick
Guide](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/get-api-key)”
- Click on 'Get Started'
- Use your class repo name for your app name (something like
cse340-LaughingChipmunks) -- competing with all other google apps for namespace
- You may need a billing account. 
- DONT LOSE YOUR API KEY or you'll have to start over. 
]

.title[Which APIs to enable?]
.body[

Minimum requirements
- Awareness API (should be turned on by default
- [See APis enabled](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/)

To do more, consider:
- Places API

.title[Using your API key]
.body[
When you have your API key, go to your android manifest and paste it
in between the quotation marks labeled API_KEY. 

Once you do that, as
described in the spec, you'll need to accept permissions and update
play when you run your code.

```xml

        <meta-data
            android:name="com.google.android.awareness.API_KEY"
            android:value="YOUR_KEY_HERE"/>
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
          android:value="YOUR_KEY_HERE"/>
```

.title[Review: Snapshots]
.body[
Current info

Requires a single callback: 
`onSnapshot(Response response)`

Setup the callback in MainActivity (pass in the type of activity)
`setSnapshotListener(Awareness.getSnapshotClient(this).getDetectedActivity(),`
`new ActivitySnapshotListener(mUpdate, mResources));`
	
Parse the response and act on it in onSnapshot

.title[What are Snapshots useful for?]
.body[
Debugging

Anything else?

.title[Review: [Fences](https://developers.google.com/awareness/)]
.body[
Conditional data

3 callbacks: during, starting, stopping

Setup in `MainActivity.java setupFenceListeners()`
```java
mActivityFenceListener = new ActivityFenceListener(
	            // during
                DetectedActivityFence.during(DetectedActivity.WALKING),
			    // starting
                DetectedActivityFence.starting(DetectedActivity.WALKING),
				// stopping
                DetectedActivityFence.stopping(DetectedActivity.WALKING),
                this, this, mUpdate);
```

What might we use for a location fence?
Headphone fence?

.title[Setting up a fence in `MainActivity.java`]
.body[
The rest is pretty boilerplate for everything

```java
if (((Checkable) v).isChecked() && 
*    ensureFineLocationAccess()) {
                mActivityFenceListener.register();
            } else {
                mActivityFenceListener.unregister();
            }
```
]
.footnote[
`ensureFineLocationAccess()` needs to be checked before anything
that uses location, e.g. weather]

.title[For lab (tomorrow)]
.body[
Try to have the base code running (e.g. everything installed;
            api keys correct) by lab
You can get help in lab or office hours

.title[Context Aware Computing Assignment]
.body[
Pick one type of context
- attach for later
- automatically execute based on context
- present info based on context

.title[System Usability Scale]
.body[
1) I think that I would like to keep using this app.

2) I found the system unnecessarily complex.

3) I thought the system was easy to use.

4) I found the use of implicit and explicit data in this app to be well integrated.

5) I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system.

6) I would imagine that most people would learn to use this system very quickly.

7) I found the system very cumbersome to use.

8) I felt very confident using the system.

.title[Group Project]
.body[
Expectations:
- Work together to decide on a focus
- Implement your App
- Make a video
]
---
.title[More Expectations:]
.body[
Divide and conquer ok for video, interface implementation,
  context-aware implementation

Should not look at sensing code by others until yours has been
  turned in 

Group participation will be assessed

Questions?
