## Introducing Heuristic Evaluation]
.right-column[
.quote[Discount usability engineering methods]

-- Jakob Nielsen
 
Involves a small team of evaluators to evaluate an interface based on recognized usability principles

Heuristics–”rules of thumb”

]
???
"serving to discover or find out," 1821, irregular formation from Gk. heuretikos "inventive," related to heuriskein "to find" (cognate with O.Ir. fuar "I have found"). Heuristics "study of heuristic methods," first recorded 1959.

.left-column[
## Introducing Heuristic Evaluation]
.right-column[

First introduced in 1990 by Nielsen & Molich

Quick, inexpensive, popular technique

~5 experts find 70-80% of problems
n
Based on 10 heuristics

Does not require working interface

## So what are the heuristics?]
--
.right-column[
H1: Visibility of system status	

H2: Match between system and the real world

H3: User control and freedom	

H4: Consistency and standards	

H5: Error prevention

H6: Recognition vs. recall	

H7: Flexibility and efficiency of use	

H8: Aesthetic and minimalist design

H9: Error recovery

H10: Help and documentation
]
???
These should not be hugely surprising after everything we've talked about...
---
.left-column[
## H1: Visibility of System Status]
.right-column[
![:img feedback being shown about how much time is left until a
database search returns, 80%](img/heuristic/visibility.png)

Keep users informed about what is going on
]
???
What input has been received--Does the interface above say what the search input was?

What processing it is currently doing--Does it say what it is currently doing?

What the results of processing are--Does it give the results of processing?

Feedback allows user to monitor progress towards solution of their
task, allows the closure of tasks and reduces user anxiety (Lavery et
al) 

---
.left-column[
## H2: Match between system and real world]
.right-column[
![:img two error messages returned by a bank machine-- one in terms the
user can understand relating to dollars available and the other
uninterpretable, 80%](img/heuristic/match.png)

Speak the users’ language

Follow real world conventions

]
???
Use concepts, language and real-world conventions that are familiar to the user.  

Developers will need to understand the task from the point of view of users.

Cultural issues relevant for the design of systems that are expected to be used globally.

A good match minimizes the xtra knowledge required to use the system,
simplying all task action mappings (re-expression of users’ intuitions
into system concepts)



---
.left-column[
## H2: Huge Violation of this heuristic
![:img Picture of macintosh desktop with old style floppy disk to be
dragged over trash to be ejected, 100%](img/heuristic/mactrash.png)
]
.right-column[

Possibly the biggest usability in problem in the Macintosh. Heuristic violation--people want to get their disk out of the machine--not discard it.

]
---
.left-column[
## H2: Mismatch depends on knowledge about users]
.right-column[
![:img Picture of a mailbox with red flag raised, 40%](img/heuristic/mailbox.png)]

Would an icon with a red flag for new mail be appropriate in all cultures?
]
---
.left-column[
## H3: User Control and Freedom]
.right-column[
![:img Dialog box with lots of exits for mistaken choices--
undo;redo;Don’t force down fixed paths, 80%](img/heuristic/control.png)

“Exits” for mistaken choices, undo, redo

Don’t force down fixed paths

]
???
Users choose actions by mistake


---
.left-column[
## H4: Consistency and Standards

]
.right-column[

Same words, situations, actions, should mean the same thing in similar
situations; same things look the same, be located in the same place.

Different things should be different

![:img Four dialogue boxes with different locations for ok; cancel and help (inconsistent), 50%](img/heuristic/consistency.png)
]

???

Difference between H2 (Match between system and the real world). and
H4--both are related to user’s prior knowledge--H2 of world; H4 of
others parts of application and other applications on the same
platform. 

Consistency within an application and within a platform. Developers
need to know platform conventions.

Consistency with old interface

Consistency maximizes the user knowledge required to use the systems
by letting users generalize from existing experience of the system to
other systems

---
.left-column[
## H4: Consistency and Standards
]
.right-column[

Evidence: Should include at least two inconsistent elements or an element and a platform guideline

Explanation: What inconsistent element is inconsistent with

![:img Four dialogue boxes with different locations for ok; cancel and help (inconsistent), 50%](img/heuristic/consistency.png)
]
---
.left-column[
## H5: Error Prevention]
.right-column[
![:img Picture of a calendar entry interface with text entry (error
prone) vs data selection (less error prone), 80%](img/heuristic/error.png)

Careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place
]
???
Help users select among legal actions (e.g., greying out inappropirate
buttons) rather than letting them select and then telling them that
they have made an error (gotcha!).  It is a subset of HA (Visibility
of system status) but is so important it gets a separate heuristics. 

Motivation: Errors are a main source of frustration, inefficiency and
ineffectiveness during system usage (Lavery et al)


Explanation in terms of tasks and system details (adjacency of
function keys and menu options, discriminability of icons and labels).

---
.left-column[
## H6: Recognition Rather than Recall]
.right-column[
![:img ,40%](img/heuristic/recognition.png)

Make objects, actions and options visible or easily retrievable

]
???
Command line interfaces classic example

Rm *

Arrows on keys that people can’t map to functions

Much easier for people to remember what to do if there are cues in the environment

Coming into working memory through perceptions.

---
.left-column[
## H7: Flexibility and Efficiency of Use]
.right-column[
![:img ,40%](img/heuristic/flexibility.png)

Accelerators for experts (e.g., gestures, kb shortcuts)

Allow users to tailor frequent actions (e.g., macros)


]
???
Typing single keys is typically faster than continually switching the
hand between the keyboard and the mouse and point to things on the
screen.  Skilled users develop plans of action, which they will want
to execute frequently, so tailoring can capture these plans in the
interface. 

---
.left-column[
## H8: Aesthetic and Minimalist design]
.right-column[
![:img ,80%](img/heuristic/minimalist.png)

Dialogs should not contain irrelevant or rarely needed information
]
???
Tufte: Chart junk

Visual search--eyes must search through more. More (irrelevant info) interferes with LTM retrieval of information that is relevant to task.

Cluttered displays have the effect of increasing search times for commands or users missing features on the screen (Lavery et al)

---
.left-column[
## H9: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors]
.right-column[
![:img ,40%](img/heuristic/error2.png)

Error messages in language user will understand

Precisely indicate the problem

Constructively suggest a solution
]

---
.left-column[
## H10: Help and Documentation]
.right-column[
![:img ,40%](img/heuristic/help.png)

Easy to search

Focused on the user’s task

List concrete steps to carry out

Always available

]

???
Allow search by gist--people do not remember exact system terms (if user ever even knew system terms).

---
.left-column[
## What does the evaluator do?]
.right-column[

Briefing (HE method, Domain, Scenario)

Two passes through interface:

Inspect flow

Inspect each screen, one at a time against heuristics

Fill out a *Usability Action Report* (we'll keep this simple in peer review)
]
???

NOT a single-user empirical test that is, do not say “I tried it and
it didn’t work therefore I’ll search for a heuristic this violates” 

---
.left-column[
## Usability Action Report
]
.right-column[
UAR rather than “Problem report” because you report good aspects as
well as problems -- you want to preserve them in the next iteration of
the system! 

- **UAR Identifier** (Type-Number) Problem or Good Aspect
- *Describe:* Succinct description of the usability aspect
- *Heuristics:* What heuristics are violated
- **Evidence:** support material for the aspect
- **Explanation:** your own interpretation
- *Severity:* your reasoning about importance 
- **Solution:** if the aspect is a problem, include a possible solution and potential trade-offs 
- **Relationships:** to other usability aspects (if any)
]
.footnote[We'll ask you to do the things in italics in peer grading]
---
.left-column[
## Writing a description]
.right-column[
Should be *A PROBLEM*, not a solution

Don't be misleading (e.g., “User couldn’t find state in the list” when
the state wasn’t in the list)

Don't be overly narrow (e.g., “PA not listed” when there is nothing
special about PA and other states are not listed) 

Don't be too broad, not distinctive (e.g., “User can’t find item”) 
]
---
.left-column[
## Picking a Heuristic]
.right-column[
Ok to list more than one

This is subjective. Use your best judgement
]
---
.left-column[
## Deciding on a severity]
.right-column[
Make a claim about factors and support it with reasons 

Consider *Frequency* (e.g., All
users would probably experience this problem because…) 

Consider *Impact*  Will it be easy or hard to overcome. NOT is the task the user
is doing important (put importance of task in explanation and in
justification of weighting, if relevant). 

Consider *Persistence* Once the problem is known, is it a one-time problem or
will the user be continually bothered? NOT low persistence because the
user abandons goal (that is impact--can’t overcome it.  If can’t
detect and can’t overcome, problem persists). 

]
???
Why? Make claim (All users would PROBABLY experience this problem BECAUSE…) and IMMEDIATELY
---
.left-column[
## Rating Severity]
.right-column[
5-point scale

0 - Not a problem at all

1 - Cosmetic problem only

2 - Minor usability problem  (fix with low priority)

3 - Major usability problem   (fix with high priority)

4 - Usability catastrophe   (imperative to fix before release)

]

---
.left-column[
## Why 5 or more people?
]
.right-column[
4 or 5 are recommended by Nielsen (this is a point of contention. I
aim for *saturation*).

A single person will not be able to find all usability problems

Different people find different usability problems

Successful evaluators may find both easy and hard problems
]
???
You can estimate how many you need (see NM book, pp 32-35).

4 or 5 are recommended by Nielsen

---
.left-column[
## Advantages of HE]
.right-column[

“Discount usability engineering” 

Intimidation low

Don’t need to identify tasks, activities

Can identify some fairly obvious fixes

Can expose problems user testing doesn’t expose

Provides a language for justifying usability recommendations

]
---
.left-column[
## Disadvantages of HE]
.right-column[
Un-validated

Unreliable

Should use usability experts

Problems unconnected with tasks

Heuristics may be hard to apply to new technology

Coordination costs
]
