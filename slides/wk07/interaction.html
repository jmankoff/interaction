Lakoff & Johnson, Metaphors We Live By

.quote[“...the way we think, what we experience, and what we do every day
is very much a matter of metaphor.” ]

.title[Metaphor]
.right-column[

For example, until I had chickens I never noticed all the chicken
metaphors in our language:

.font-small[
- “A hen is only an egg's way of making another egg.” - Samuel Butler
- “The key to everything is patience. You get the chicken by hatching the egg, not by smashing it.” - unknown
- "Regard it as just as desirable to build a chicken house as to build a cathedral." - Frank Lloyd Wright
- "A chicken in every pot" - 1928 Republican Party campaign slogan
- "Don't have a pot to put it in" - 1928 Democratic Party response slogan
- Nest egg - to save a little money each week
- Scratching out a living - to earn enough to get by on
- Don't count your chickens before they hatch - don't plan on an outcome before it actually happens.
- Don't put all your eggs in one basket - don't plan on an outcome before it actually happens.
- Feather your nest - saving for the future
- Mother hen - very protective
- Flew the coop - gone
- Walking on eggshells- treading softly where certain people are concerned; trying not to upset someone
- Like a chicken with it's head cut off - running around with no direction
- You're chicken! - being afraid
- Hard-boiled - tough attitude
- Ruffle your feathers - something annoys you
- No spring chicken - you're old. Plain and simple.
- Hatch an idea - put a plan into motion
- Pecking order - finding your place
- Brood over it - to worry; to hover over a problem
- Chicken scratch - poor handwriting
- Stick your neck out - go to bat for someone else
- Stuck in your craw - upset about something and won't verbalize what's going on inside you; carrying a grudge.
- Bad egg - less than honest person; poor moral standards
- In a stew - got yourself in trouble
- Raise your hackle feathers - visibly annoyed 
- Nesting behavior- preparing a home (especially pregnant women just before a baby is due)
- Empty nest syndrome - depression and loneliness when children leave home
- Made from scratch - made from raw materials by hand

Critique!

???
Unwieldy,

Not great use of screen real estate

Other?

.title[Better option?]
.right-column[
Can use metaphors to leverage existing conceptual models
- Not really an attempt to simulate a real desktop
- Leverages existing knowledge about files, folders, trash
- A way to explain why some windows seem blocked

# Relating the Human and the Machine

- Gulf of Execution and Gulf of Evaluation

Gulf of execution is the user 'error' region (user requests
function the __system DOESNT HAVE__)

Gulf of
  evaluation is when the user __doesn't realize the system HAS a
functionality__.

- Where are the gulf of evaluation and gulf of execution in this
  image?  Gulf of execution is the user 'error' region (user requests
  function the __system DOESNT HAVE__), gulf of
  evaluation is when the user __doesn't realize the system HAS a
  functionality__. 
  
- How does undo help the user bridge them?

Gulf of Evaluation

---

# Causes of Gulf of Evaluation
???
- Hard to understand visual feedback
- Poor use of colors
- Bad layout, poor grouping
- Unfamiliar display of information
- Unfamiliar design patterns, or doesn’t follow convention
- Forcing people to remember lots of things
- Lack of feedback in response to inputs
- Might not see visual updates
- Can’t find info on screen 
- Might look same as unimportant
- Irrelevant info on screen / important info missing
---
# Causes of Gulf of Execution
???
- Unfamiliar devices and inputs
- Don’t know what is possible
- Unfamiliar GUI components 
- Solvable with experience
- Unfamiliar interaction patterns
- Also solvable with experience
- Example patterns: Dialogs, Shopping Carts

Good Affordance| Bad Affordance
----|----
![:img Picture of a round doorknob, 40%](img/interaction/round-doorknob.png) | ![:img Picture of a flat doorknob, 40%](img/interaction/flat-doorknob.png) 

Well-designed objects have affordances
- Clues to their operation that are readily apparent
- Often visual, but not always (e.g., speech)
- Allows and promotes certain actions
]
???
Opportunities to act which are readily apparent to the user ... and
appropriate to the user’s abilities 

Form “affords” certain actions and makes that apparent

.title[Design Tip #2: Use *Affordances* to minimize errors
]
.body[

Action | Physical Affordance | Virtual Affordance |  Minimal Design
----|----|----|----
Gripping | ![:img picture of knurling on a knob,45%](img/interaction/knurling.png) | ![:img Image of lines indicating a grabbable corner by imitating knurling,50%](img/interaction/virtual-knurling.png)

Search | No Real World Equivalent || ![:img Text area for search. Uses greyed out text to suggest what should go in it, 55%](img/interaction/search.png)
]
???
Knurling: increases friction/affords gripping

don't kneed to know the word to get it

.title[Feedback]
.body[
Response by the system to the actions of the user – Cause and effect

Essential for forming mental models

Makes “system state” visible

Messenger Feedback | and | Gmail Feedback

.title[Design Tip #3 Make the Conceptual Model Visible]
.right-column[
Explicitly design a conceptual model 

Use affordance and feedback
(and everything else you have) to reinforce it
]

---
.title[Feed Forward]
.right-column[
What will happen if you execute action
- Ex. Web page mouseover
- Ex. Word processing I-bar
- Ex. Label on a button

Help people predict what will happen
- Need feedforward at all scales
- GUI widgets will handle basic feedforward
- Don’t forget feedforward for screens
