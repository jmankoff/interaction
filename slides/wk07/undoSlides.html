[//]: # (Outline Slide)
.left-column[# Today's goals]
.right-column[
- Introduce Undo conceptually 
- Describe Implementation details for assignment
]
---
.left-column[
## Quick updates
]
.right-column[
Changes to code base, same basic approach for new FAB
- See SPEC and comments in code for most up to date info

Working hard on Menus and midterm grading. People are doing *very*
well on Menus part 2. 

Will be away this afternoon and all day tomorrow. Back on Friday for
class

## Remember this?

Dispatch Strategies
- Bottom-first and top-down positional
- Focus-based

Propositional Production System describes *within-view* response to events

Callbacks handle *application* response to events

.right-column-half[
Callbacks handle *application* response to events
- Update Application Model
- Best implemented using custom listeners

.title[What is `ActionPerformed`?]
.body[
`Higher level` input event (`Command` or `Action` object)
 - Puts some  separation between UI and translation objects
 - Application (or UI) can ‘listen’ for these events: 

Key advantage: interactors don’t need to know who/what got notification
Same basic flow as simple callbacks 
]
---
.title[What should an Action object do?]
.body[
`doAction()`
]

???
seems like a lot of work when we could just directly do the
action. Major reason for action objects
--
.body[
`undoAction()`
]

???
What additional information do we need to undo an action?

---
.title[Advantages of an action object]
.body[
- can be stored on an undo stack
- can create a consistent abstraction for reversing an action
]
---
.left-column[
## Undo and Redo]
.right-column[
1) new action object created and `doAction()` called

2) Undo stack updated

3) new action object created and `doAction()` called

4) Undo stack updated

5) `undo()` invoked

6) Undo stack reduced and Redo stack increased

7) `undo()` invoked

8) Undo stack reduced and Redo stack increased

.left-column[
## Undo and Redo]
.right-column[
9) `redo()` invoked

10) Redo stack decreased and Undo stack increased

11) new action object created and `doAction()` called

12) Redo stack cleared and Undo stack stack increased
]
---
.left-column[
## What if an action can't be undone?]
.right-column[
Actions that put system into a totally different context

Clear both `undo` *and* `redo` stacks! Users may hate you]
???
example? Saving a file

.left-column[
## Implementing `undo()`
]
.right-column[

System pops action off undo stack

Calls `undoAction()` method on it

Pushes it on redo stack
]
---
.left-column[
## Why is `undoAction()` hard?
]
.right-column[
Two ways to implement:

- *Direct Code* (each action object has custom code)
 - Need parameters of original action 
 - Better store in `doAction()` for later
 - This is what we will implement
]
---
.left-column[
## Why is `undoAction()` hard?
]
.right-column[
Two ways to implement:

- *Direct Code* (each action object has custom code)
- *Change Records* (Keep a record of the “old value” for everything
changed by the application, then put all those values back to undo)
 - More general
 - Takes more space
 - `Action` object records `ChangeRecord` (changes which are abstracted into a
 common data format) 
 - Application has to provide code to restore from change records

.right-column[

---
.left-column[
## More sophisticated forms of Undo
]
.right-column[
Explicit visualization of steps

Manipulation of action list 

Delete actions from the middle, reorder, etc.
by undoing back to point of change then redoing forward 

But note: doAction() must be able to work in new context
