Model
- Model of a single interactor: Typically a field

View

- Interactor hierarchy in an application

Controller

</div>

Implement `onTouch()` for this PPS, assuming there is an
`essentialGeometry(Point p)` method available to you and that
implementations for `onEnter()`, `onUpdate()`, `Keep()` and
`Discard()` are provided. In addition, you can assume a field, `state`
and an enum `Geometry` which has values `Geometry.INSIDE` and
`Geometry.OUTSIDE` for checking your geometry and an enum `State` with
values for all states in the state machine. 

]

.title[Solution]
.body[
```java
public boolean onTouch(MotionEvent e) {
  geometry = essentialGeometry(new Point(e.getX(), e.getY());
  switch(state) {
    case State.START: 
   	   if (geometry == Geometry.INSIDE && e.getAction() == MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN) {
           onEnter();
		   this.state = State.DRAWING;
	   }
	case DRAWING
    ...
```

Wait for *Event*

*Dispatch* may cause change to:
- interactor state
- interactor hierarchy
- application model

.title[Core Toolkit Architecture]
.body[
If damage do
- *layout* (may change)
 - position
 - size
- If damage do *redraw* 
 - Union of damage (any of those can cause it) used to trigger redraw of anything inside that union
 - Drawing + clipping – standard drawing order, but only for things damaged; clipped to damage region
 - Clear damage

.right-column-half[
You are implementing selection in a drawing program.  A touch press event arrives, with location (4,4). The interactor hierarchy is:

<div class="mermaid">
graph LR
canvas[Drawing Canvas] --> CA[CircleA, Green]
CA --> LA[LineA, Black]
canvas --> LB[LineB, Orange]
LB --> PA[PointA, Blue]
LB --> PB[PointB, Black]

classDef start fill:#d1e0e0,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px;
classDef invisible fill:#FFFFFF,stroke:#FFFFFF,color:#FFFFFF

class canvas,CA,LA,LB,PA,PB normal
</div>

A) What will be first...last in the pick list?

B) What will be first in bubble?

## Output/Drawing Concepts
]
.right-column[
Drawing primitives – populate a pixel array

Coordinate transformations (translate/scale/rotate/shear) & Clipping

Fonts
- Archaic origins
- Non standardized
- UI toolkit implications?

.left-column[
## Drawing Architecture
]
.right-column[
Damage/Redraw invoked by `invalidate()` or equivalent

Drawing is recursive
- Makes it possible for parent to *decorate* kids
- Parent responsible for making kids think they are the center of the universe (translate)
- Clipping: intersect parent and child, also handled by parent

.left-column[
## Input/Event Concepts

Devices

- Logical: Valuator, Locator, Button, etc
- Event vs. sampled devices
- Absolute vs. Relative (and clutched)

Event model to unify event and sampled devices
- What
- When
- Where

Dispatch Strategies

.title[How an animation is set up]
.body[
Need the start and end value of the properties to be
modified. Typically use a
[Path](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Path)
for this. 

Need a *duration* (total time in ms for the animation)

Need the *pacing function* for animation. Can explore subclasses of
[Interpolator](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/animation/Interpolator)
(or make your own!) for this

.title[HSV]
.body[
RGB matches the eye (rods & cones, red green and blue)

HSV is much better for *people*
- Hue: Dominant wavelength of light
- Saturation: Purity (how much white/black mixed in)
- Value: Luminance or amount of light in color = max(R,G,B)
]

## Example Short Answer Exam Question
![:img Darker and lighter red boxes, 80%](img/midterm/redcomp.png)
![:img Red with varying saturation (to white) and value (to black), 80%](img/midterm/value-sat.png)

]
.right-column[
# Compare the following colors using HSV
Which is correct?

- A: Top color has different *hue* than bottom color
- B: Top color has higher *saturation* than bottom color
- C: Top color has higher *value* than bottom color
]
???
B: Saturation

.title[Know your speeds (order of magnitude is key thing here)]
.body[
< ~20ms (1/50 sec) discrete images/flashes merge into continuous perception

smooth animation: 24-40  frames per second 

< ~100-200ms seems like “instant response”
- on web a difference of 250 ms can switch people to a competitor

< 1-2 seconds typically “good response time”

More than 10-15 sec is typically “bad response time”


]

.title[Recap of design tips]
.body[
- Don't rely on blue for small objects
- Don't rely on blue for older users
- Make sure that contrast is high enough
- Minimize saturated colors
- Use redundant cues
- Make things distinct
- Use small multiples
- Manage expectations if you can't change response time
- Replace subtle changes with obvious ones
- Use well-tested visual grouping strategies
- Minimize the number of options 
- Rely on recognition rather than recall

# Fitts Law

![:img Picture of graph of fitts law data collected when I did the
experiment. Y axis is time and x is index of difficulty. It's fairly
noisy because fitts law is designed to measure multiple
people. However it does fit a line., 80%](img/midterm/timeoverid.png)

Fitts' law only applies to *error-free, expert* behavior
]
.right-column-half[
.jax[$$MT = a + b*log_2({Dist \over Size} + 1)$$
]

where
- *MT* is movement time
- *ID/MT* is the *Throughput* of a device in bits/second
- *a* and *b* are empirically derived constants 
- ID is the *Index of Difficulty* (ID, in bits) of a movement
.jax[$$log_2({Dist \over Size} + 1)$$]


]
???
This is just a line

Fitts’ law tells us about difficulty for pointing and selection tasks
- Time to move the hand depends only on relative precision required
- MT increases as __distance__ from target increases
- MT decreases as __size__ of target increases
- Diagram this

Fitts' law only applies to expert behavior

.title[Design tips derived from motor principals]
.body[
Design Tip #1: Make small targets larger

Design Tip #2: Put commonly used things close together

Design Tip #3: Make use of Edges: They are Infinite

Design Tip #4: Use pie menus instead of context menus for expert tasks

Design Tip #5: Use snapping to minimize distance<br> when likely
targets are known

Design Tip #6: Separate Motor Size from Visible Size

## Example coding question about layout XML
]
.right-column[
Below is the layout XML of one review picked from a column of reviews for a restaurant. 

Draw the views as they would be positioned inside a ConstraintLayout in portrait on a 450dp x 800dp screen
- In place of images and text, write the @ resource.
- Note the top left point and dimensions of each view in `dp`, or `-` if unknown
- Assume the button's content is 40dp tall.

.title[Solution:]

![:img Rendered layout from the XML above,80%](img/midterm/layout_sol.svg)

Solution is a drawing, with the following widths:

Width of @id/food0: 90dp<br/>
Width of @id/helpful0: 450 - 90 - 32 - 32 - 16 = 280dp<br/>
Width of @id/reviewText0: = width of @id/helpful0 = 280dp
