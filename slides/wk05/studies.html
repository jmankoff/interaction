3 tasks x 2 menu types = 6 *conditions*:

| | Normal | Pie |
|--|--|--|
| **Linear** |  |  |
| **Relational** |  |   |
| **Unclassified** |  |  |

- In each *condition* we test  `ITEM_MAX` different menu items
- For each menu item, we repeat `NUM_REPEATS` times

## Other Method considerations
]
.right-column[
An experimental *session* consists of 3 tasks x 2 menu types x
`ITEM_MAX` items x `NUM_REPEATS` repetitions = 72 *trials* in your homework

You have to run four participants through a complete session = 72 * 4
or 288 data points.

Participants do *all* trials (some designs participants only do some conditions)

Order of presentation of conditions and items is randomized (why?)

items were selected per menu, and how many times each item was
repeated. Describe how many trials each participant completed. This
should be at most one paragraph`

Top row: Prior (what's known to be true before the experiment)
bottom row: Calculated p-value

Notice the middle column, where something that is a toss-up has higher
plausability than we would expect. This is a "Type 1 error"

Alternatively, a small sample may cause a Type II error (failure to
detect a true difference) due to random sampling bias

Statistical Significance: Something like
`Pie menus were twice as fast as normal menus (M=.48s vs M=.83s), F(1,43)=295.891, p<.05. Unclassified menu items were harder to find than linear and relative ones (M=.84s, .59s, and .59s respectively), F(2,43)=93.778, p<0.5. We also found an interaction effect between menu and task (as illustrated in the chart above), F(5, 43) = 51.945, p<.001.`

.title[Limitations of Laboratory Studies]

???
Simulate real world environments
- Location and equipment may be unfamiliar to participant [Coyne & Nielsen 2001]
- Observation may effect performance - “Hawthorne Effect” [Mayo 1933] 
- Participant may become fatigued and not take necessary rest - “Demand Effect” [Orne 1962]
- Tasks frequently artificial and repetitive, which may bore participants and negatively effect performance
Studying real world use removes these limitations
