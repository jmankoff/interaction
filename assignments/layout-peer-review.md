# Layout Peer Review

- For peer review, you will be looking at the *Part 4* submissions for the layout assignment. In particular, you will be evaluating the extent to which a student faithfully reproduces their chosen application layout.

- First, you should check the wireframe to see what layout the student was attempting to create. If you have the app, or have quick access to it, it's also good to download and run that app alongside the student submission for comparison.

# Layout Criteria

## External Criteria

- Layout wireframe is present and filled out.

- Wireframe is representative of both the chosen application, and the running submission.

- Layout is responsive to orientation. If using the emulator, click the device rotation buttons to check this criteria.

- Layout is able to scroll in some clear way.

## Additional Feedback
