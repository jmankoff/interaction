# Review and Reflection on Custom Layout Submission

## Paragraph 1: Reflection on Part 4

---

You should spend at least a paragraph describing your submission for part 4. This reflection is open ended, however you should take the following guidelines into consideration:

* Inspiration
    * If your layout submission is based on the layout of another popular interface, what interface did you use? If the layout was designed for another platform, what considerations did you take when porting it over to Android?
    * If your layout submission is original, what inspired your decisions regarding layout and design? Was there anything you used as a resource when considering layout?
        * Additionally, if you choose to go this route you should take a sentence or two to describe the use case of your mock layout application.

* Implementation
    * What resources did you use within Android Studio to accomplish your desired layout?

* Successes and Struggles
    * How successful do you feel with your submission? What worked and what didn't? Is there anything that you wanted to implement but could not figure out?

<!-- do we want to do this? -->
In addition, you should provide a labeled draft of your current app layout. The blueprint view in the visual studio is a good starting point for this.
