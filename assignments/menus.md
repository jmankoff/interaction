# Overview of assignment

This is a two part assignment. The coding should take about 5 hours,
and re-uses many concepts from [ColorPicker](colorpicker.html). Please
start early, and reach out if you find you are spending more than 10
hours. 

The user study will take about the same. Your time will include the following:
Write your consent form using our template and print out (1 hr)
recruit, consent and run 4 participants (1-2 hours); Download your
data and importing it into the spreadsheet we provide (30 mins);
Analyze the data (1 hr) and write the report (1-2 hours). Again, reach
out if spending more than double the expected time. 

# Key Files to look at 

* ExperimentSession.java
  * Class that sets up all the conditions for the experiment and creates an iterator with all the trials.
* ExperimentTrial.java
  * Class that stores all the data for a single trial.

# Part 0: Overview
Read this spec and take a look at the classes listed above.

You will be implementing a class that can display a pie menu, and a
class that can display a linear menu for use in an experiment
comparing which is faster for the user to select menu items from. By
*menu items* we mean the individual items in a menu, such as the
number 1 in the sample video. 

This experiment will have 6 conditions, each of which will include
`NUM_REPEATS*ITEM_MAX` trials, as follows.

|  | Menus | | 
|--|--|--|
|**Tasks** | `PIE` | `NORMAL`|
| `LINEAR`    | NUM_REPEATS*ITEM_MAX | NUM_REPEATS*ITEM_MAX| 
| `RELATIVE`  | NUM_REPEATS*ITEM_MAX | NUM_REPEATS*ITEM_MAX| 
| `UNCLASS`  | NUM_REPEATS*ITEM_MAX | NUM_REPEATS*ITEM_MAX| 

<br>
The two *menu types* (specified in an `Enum` in the code) are `PIE`
(round) and `NORMAL` (linear).

The three *task types* (also an `Enum`) are `LINEAR` (menu items such as
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8) ; `RELATIVE` (menu items such as
Up/UpRight/Right/Down/etc...); and `UNCLASS` (menu items such as
Print/Cast/Bookmark/etc);

The *trials* are specific combinations of menu item, task type,
and menu type. So for example, one trial might involve showing the
user a pie menu, with the numbers 1..8 in it, and asking them to
select number 3. The participant can select any option, no matter what
as soon as they complete a selection, the result is recorded and the
next trial begins. 

For any given *session* (one user's worth of trials), each combination
of menu type, task type, and menu item, will be repeated `NUM_REPEATS`
times (`NUM_REPEATS` is specified in `ExperimentSession.java`). In
addition, for any specific combination of menu type and task type, at
most `ITEM_MAX` items (a total of `ITEM_MAX*NUM_REPEATS` trials) will
be shown to the user. If you set both of these to 1 for testing, you
can test all your conditions very quickly. Make sure to set them to
the required values for user testing: `NUM_REPEATS` must be at least
3, and `ITEM_MAX` must be at least 4.

In the second half (week 2) of this project, you will recruit 4
friends or students and have them complete one session each. Thus, you
will have a total of 4 (participant sessions) * 6 (conditions) *
`ITEM_MAX*NUM_REPEATS`, or 288, data points when you have completed
this assignment. You will analyze the data from this experiment in
part 2 of this project. 


We have implemented in `ExperimentSession` the code for you to generate
all of the trials from a setup file called `menuContents.csv` found in
the assets directory. Look at ExperimentSession.java, please understand
`createTrials` method which sets up conditions for
whole experiment.  `ExperimentSession` is an iterator, so to run the
trials for a give session you just use `session.next` as long as
`session.getNext` is true.

# Part 1: Implement MenuExperimentView and MainActivity
**Tasks**
- Implement `onDraw` in `MenuExperimentView`
- Implement `onTouchEvent` `MenuExperimentView`
- Implement `showMenuForTrial` in `MainActivity`
- Implement `onTrialCompleted` in `MainActivity`

For this part, you will be working in `MenuExperimentView.java`. This
class includes several fields that you will need to implement. You
will implement the state machine logic in `onTouchEvent` (similar to
what you've done in ColorPicker) and the logic to draw the menu in
`onDraw`. You will also implement the code necessary to add and remove
menu views from the application when a trial ends and
`onOptionSelected()` is called.

One tricky thing about context menus -- they can appear anywhere in
your user interface. To support this, we set things up so that the
menu view is going to `MATCH_PARENT` width and height. However, the
menu itself should show up right where the user presses down. 

**Handling Touch Events**

You will handle touch input by implementing the `onTouchEvent`
method. This is the event handler that is invoked when a touch occurs
in this view. Note that `onTouchEvent` is implemented in the parent
class, `MenuExperimentView` and *is not changed* in the child
classes. The only thing they have to modify for `onTouchEvent` to
work properly is `essentialGeometry`, since they have the exact same
state machine. 

- For the `PieMenu`, `essentialGeometry` should return -1 if the pointer
  has moved less than `MIN_DIST` since selection started, and
  otherwise return the item number currently being selected. Item
  number is the menu item that a ray from
  the center of the menu to the pointer intersects.
- For the `NormalMenu`, `essentialGeometry` should return -1 if the
  pointer is outside the bounds of the menu in any direction or has
  moved less than `MIN_DIST` since interaction started. Otherwise it
  should return the item number of the menu item that the pointer is
  currently inside of. 

You need to keep track of two main states `START` and
`SELECTING`. When in the `SELECTING` state you need to distinguish
between the event type to determine if the user has selected an option
or if they are still in the middle of making a choice. 

Relevant mouse events include `ACTION_DOWN`, `ACTION_MOVE`, and
`ACTION_UP`; think about how these mouse events relate to the change
and how the UI should respond to these events. 


<div class="mermaid">

classDef invisible fill:#FFFFFF,stroke:#FFFFFF,color:#FFFFFF

class S invisible
class A start
class E finish
class I normal
</div>

where the actions should be as follows:

```java
startSelection() {
// 0) record starting point
// 1) call trial.startTrial(), passing it the 
// pointer position
// 2) invalidate
}
endSelection() {
// 1) call trial.endTrial(), passing it the pointer 
// position and the currently selected item
// 2) call onTrialCompleted(trial)
}
dragResult(){
// check if the item selected has changed. If so
// 1) update your menu's model
// 2) invalidate
}
```

Note that you do not need to check whether the user clicked on the
correct menu item when you call endTrial(). 

**Implement onDraw**

For `onDraw()`, your will do some setup that will allow your
subclasses to draw properly. First, you will need to check if you are
in the proper state to draw (only draw when in the `SELECTING`
state).

Next, you really want to draw from the (0,0) location of the menu,
rather than the (0,0) of the parent. But remember that your width and
height are set using `MATCH_PARENT`. To fix this, we need to change
the coordinate system of the canvas so that (0,0) is at the
`startPoint` for this interaction.

Finally, since this is an abstract class, we need to call the *real*
drawing method, which our children will implement. This is called
`drawMenu()` and should be overridden by `PieMenuView` and
`NormalMenuView`.  Therefore, your `onDraw` implementation in
`MenuExperimentView.java` will be pretty short.

The starter code contains several useful fields that are 
useful for drawing the menus on screen. For PieMenu, the given `RADIUS`
corresponds to the outer radius. The inner radius is defined by `RADIUS - TEXT_SIZE * 2`.

**MainActivity**

In MainActivity you will implement the method
`showMenuForTrial(ExperimentTrial trial)`. This method will create a
new `MenuExperimentView` of the type specified in the trial, set its
layout parameters so that it fills its parent and is visible on the
screen, and register a callback with it that knows what to do when a
trial is completed.

MainActivity also needs to implement the code to respond to
`onTrialCompleted`. In particular, this code should always remove the
current menu being shown. Then it should check if the session is
over (remember the session is an iterator), and if not call
`showMenuForTrial` with the next trial. If the session is over, it
should update text of `InstructionTextView` to say that the session is
completed. This means that until the next session is started, the system should not display any menus
if the user clicks. You can also display a
[Toast](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/notifiers/toasts).

# Part 2: Implement Pie and Normal Menus

**Tasks**

- `PieMenuView`: Implement `essentialGeometry` and `drawMenu`
- `NormalMenuView`: Implement `essentialGeometry` and `drawMenu`

Both `PieMenuView` and `NormalMenuView` extend `MenuExperimentView`. You
will implement `essentialGeometry` and determine what menu item the
touch event maps to. You'll have to come up with the math logic to map
from touch event to an item index. 

You will also implement `drawMenu` which at a minimum draws the menus as shown in
the screenshots. If you want to do something different, you may, as
long as the size and position of each menu item does not change. For
example, you can  override the paint properties defined in
`MenuExperimentView`, position the text differently, or draw more
decorations on the menus. 

The radius of the circle in the pie menu is `RADIUS - TEXT_SIZE * 2`.
The width of each item in the normal menu is `CELL_WIDTH` and the height is
`CELL_HEIGHT`.

## Some hints for the pie menu

- `drawArc` will draw a pizza-pie shaped arc, so you can do things
  like highlight a menu item with a single method call. 
- You will need a rotational offset to ensure the top menu item is at
  the top of the pie (both when drawing and in essential geometry)
  because angle is traditionally measured from cardinal east. You can
  add this in radians before converting from angle to index.

# Part 3: Conduct and Write Up User Study

**Tasks**
- Conduct user study 
 - Run a trial on yourself
 - Create a final consent form from [this sample](consent.html)
 - Recruit 4 participants
 - Have them sign your consent form
 - Have them complete a session with `MAX_ITEMS` set to at least 4 and
   `NUM_REPEATS` set to 3. 
 - Download the recorded data 
- Analyze recorded data 
- Write a report

**Conduct User Study**

To finalize the [consent form](consent.html), you will need to copy over the text from
our sample consent and modify it in all of the places marked as
such. You should print out two copies of the consent form for each
participant -- one for them and one for you.

You will need to try out your own program as a participant to fill in
the consent form (since you'll need to know how long it takes. This is
also a good time to double check that your data is not lost by
downloading it. 

*Downloading your data*

On mac OS X, `adb pull /storage/emulated/0/CSE340_PieMenu/TestResult.csv` will
download your data to the current directory you are in (or you can
specify a location).

On all platforms, if you have Android Studio installed you can use
a tool window called `Device File Manager`. This allows you to directly
access the files on your Android device (emulated or physical) through a
GUI window. If you aren't comfortable with using adb over the the command line,
this is a great option.

1) Connect your Android device. If you use an emulator just start the emulator like
you usually would. If you use a physical device connect it to your computer over
USB like you usually would when loading your Android apps.

2) In the top menu, press View -> Tool Windows -> Device File Explorer. This will
open a window that details the contents of your Android device's file system.

![:img Screenshot of a normal menu](menus-img/device-file-explorer.png){:float="left"}

3) Navigate to `/storage/emulated/0/CSE340_PieMenu/TestResult.csv`. You should be able
to open the file and even save it elsewhere on your computer's file system. 

*Create a clean CSV* 

You should use the hamburger menu in the app you just implemented to `Clear Result CSV`
before starting your study so that your data does not contaminate your results.

*Recruit participants and have them sign your consent form* 

You can ask friends or classmates for help. Do
not *coerce* anyone into participating in your study. Make sure they
know they have a choice, and have read and signed the consent
form. You will be required to *turn in signed consent forms* with your
report.

*Collect data* 

Have each participant complete a session. Once *all*
participants are done, you and download your final data file. It
should have 72*4 (288) data points in it. You can use the emulator or your
phone for this, and any mouse you want. You will need to turn in your
final data file with your report. 

**Write a Report**

You will need to write up a brief report about your study. We 
provide a [template](menu-report).
