<h1> Welcome to Interaction Programming! </h1>
Interactive technology is changing society. Some of today’s interfaces are used by a billion people at a time. Almost everything we create is created for people to use, through user interfaces. We will learn about interactive systems, including programming paradigms and design of event handling, layout, undo, accessibility and context awareness.

# Should I take this class?

Yes! Some of today’s interfaces are being used by a billion people at
a time. Almost everything we create is created for people to use, and
user interfaces are how people interact with anything else you do
(whether it is a new machine learning algorithm or a database
system). User interfaces are incredibly important, but they also
represent a different programming paradigm than you may have learned
before. This class will teach you

- How to write an event-driven program which reacts to user input and
  displays output. If you’ve never done this before, the abstractions
  you will learn are standard in almost any user interface toolkit. Even
  if you have, too often, without attention to structure, interfaces
  become impenetrable spaghetti code.
- How to think about the design of novel interaction techniques. As
  devices diversify, so too do the ways in which people interact, from
  voice based interfaces to augmented reality. By understanding the
  principles of interaction technique design you can do a better job of
  making interactions that users will want, which improves both the user
  experience and the business value of what you create.
- How to avoid common gotchas in the implementation of user
  interfaces. We will teach you the proper way to implement Undo and create
  Accessible Interfaces. We will also touch on other necessities (no
  modal dialogues; good use of color; inclusion of support for help and
  so on).

Taking a class is a big commitment, and you will work hard in this
class. So we want to help you make sure this is the right class for
you. Below is some information about prerequisites and expectations.

# Prereqs and expectations

The only requirement for this class is that you have taken CS 142 and
143 or an equivalent class, meaning you are comfortable programming in
Java, and have some experience with data structures. However, if you
are not comfortable working in an IDE environment, using version
control, and picking up and working with someone else’s library code,
you will likely need to plan for extra time with TAs, and possibly
attend extra tutoring sessions, to keep up with the class.
A good plan is to take 391 just before or concurrently with 340 to learn some of these things.

The specific platform and language for this class are Java on Android
phones (or simulators); using the IntelliJ IDE (Android Studio). While
Google is switching over to Kotlin, there are good reasons to [start
learning Android with Java first](https://dzone.com/articles/java-vs-kotlin-which-language-android-developer-sh).

Note that this class is designed for CS majors, and other students who
work regularly with information technology and are strong
programmers. While we will consider applications from outside the
major, financial and room restrictions may limit
space for such students.

# Other relevant classes to know about

There are a number of classes on campus that teach related concepts
which you may wish to consider in addition to this one. As of summer,
2018, here are the ones we are aware of:

- HCID 520: User Interface Software +
  Technology ([Wi 17](http://uwdata.github.io/hcid520/17wi/), [Wi 16](http://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/hcid520/) [Wi 19](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1256337))
  This course
  teaches about user interfaces, including what they are, how they are
  built, and some inventions in user interface software and
  technology. There are many similarities between these classes. However HCID 520
  is only open to [MHCI+D students](https://mhcid.washington.edu/) Masters students.
- [HCDE 310: Interactive Systems Design &
  Technology](https://www.smunson.com/teaching/hcde310/a13/) This course is a
  project based course that teaches how to prototype applications on the
  web using Python that solve human problems or enable new
  activities. Includes information about APIs and how people interact with them. It
  differs from CSE 340 in its choice of platform. Additionally, it
  doesn’t cover the theory of UI programming, nor issues such as
  accessibility, undo, and so on.
- [INFO 343: Client side web
  development](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1118282) This is a
  programming course, and there will be significant overlap between the
  courses, as INFO 343 also touches on event based programming, output,
  and accessibility. [CSE 154: Web
  Programming](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/18sp/)
  also covers some related
  material. However, both are about programming on the web using
  JavaScript instead of on Android, using Java. In addition, CSE 340
  covers more of the theory of UI programming and design, similar to
  HCID 520.
- [HCID 521: Prototyping](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1128377/assignments/syllabus)
  This class is for the [MHCI+D students](https://mhcid.washington.edu/)
  only and focuses on prototyping techniques, not implementation. It
  covers everything from paper prototyping to physical interfaces to 3D
  printing.
- [CSE 440: Introduction to
  HCI](http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse440/); [441: Advanced HCI](http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse441/) This is an advanced series of courses for undergraduate
  seniors. The focus of 440 is less on programming and more broadly on
  methods for designing, prototyping, and evaluating user interfaces to
  computing applications, while 441 is an open ended capstone
  course. These are excellent follow on courses to 340, for a student
  who wants to go deeper into how to make usable, enjoyable effective
  interfaces, and how to solve interesting problems with HCI. Related is
  [CSE 510](http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/csep510/), the HCI
  course for the professional masters program.

# Course Structure

Many of the goals in this class center around learning by doing. This
means that hands on time trying out everything from implementation to
evaluation is critical to learning. An educational approach that can
support this is active learning. To support this, class time will be
used as much as possible for activities, discussion, review, and
homework. Preparation outside of class and participation in class are
both very important and will improve your class experience. Stay on
top of course materials, bring your questions to class and seek help
if there are problems.

# Workload

This is a challenging, four credit class, meaning you should expect 8
hours of homework a week. We hope make the workload as predictable as
possible. You can expect your weeks to look look something like this:

- **Monday:** Come to class ready for discussion and activity
- **Tuesday:** Do your Wednesday reading and quiz 
- **Wednesday:** Come to class ready for discussion and activity;
  Finish your homework by class today [8-10 hours]
- **Thursday:** Come to lab ready to work on your homework;
  do your Friday reading and quiz 
- **Friday:** Come to class ready for discussion and activity
- **Weekend:** Focus on your homework. Most Monday classes will have no assigned reading.

Homework will typically be assigned on Wednesday after class and due on the following Wednesday before class, though in some cases there is an earlier deadline. 

# Class Coordination

We want you to succeed in this class, and an important way that you do
that is by asking questions and discussing course issues with your
peers and teaching staff. Some ways to do that include:

- We have a class discussion board on [Piazza]({{site.piazza}}), where you can
  make public posts that benefit the whole class, and are answered more
  quickly because your fellow students can help the course staff by
  responding also. This is the best way to ask questions about things
  like homework. Before posting, please search through the questions
  that have already been posted in case someone has already asked the
  same question.
- We hold office hours (see [Piazza Staff Page]({{site.piazza}}/staff)). If none of those times work for
  you. You can also discuss matters with us privately on
  [Piazza]({{site.piazza}}). Using Piazza gets
  the whole course staff at once and is usually faster than
  email. Lastly, if none of these work for you you can send an email
  asking to set up an appointment.

# Class Expectations

The class is a shared learning environment, and it is important that
you treat everyone in the class with respect. Some specific things we
will do to try to make the class a welcoming environment:

- **Accessibility**: I have attempted to make all the course materials
  accessible according to web standards. If you need any additional
  support, I am always happy to work with you and the Disabled Students Office to make sure
  that the class meets your needs
- **Inclusivity**: I will be working toward a broad base of examples,
  and a welcoming environment for all. Please let me know if you see
  opportunities to improve this.
- **Sharing and Group Projects**: Working together is encouraged, as
  long as you in the end implement your own code, and make sure to
  document any information you get from other students in comments at
  the top of the relevant file. You will work on
  one of your projects in pairs.

# Grading

Grades will be assigned approximately as follows:

- 70%: Assignments
- 10%: Effort, participation and altruism
- 20%: Exams

To estimate your final GPA, multiply your current overall grade (from 0 to 100) by 4 and divide by 100.

# Late Days

Each homework will allow late days with a 10% penalty per day. Partial days may not be used (i.e., 12 hours late is a 10% deduction, not 5%). You are allowed to use up to 2 late days on each assignment, after which turn-ins will be given a zero.

For the quarter, three **penalty-free** late days are provided which can be used on assignments by filling out the late day request form posted on Piazza.

- Penalty-free late days also pause late penalty accumulation. _For example, one late is day is used, but the assignment is turned in two days late: -10%._
